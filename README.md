http://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi

babel-node can run es6 code in node, should not be used in production

compat, eslint plugin that warns you if you use js apis that are not available in the browsers ou need to support

nodemon for restarting server when files change

 - runs in the background, the log command gets a stream of logs 

babel-plugin-flow-react-proptypes: automatically add proptypes from flow annotations in react components

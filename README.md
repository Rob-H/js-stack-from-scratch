# Notes

me working through [this](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch)


http://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi

babel-node can run es6 code in node, should not be used in production

compat, eslint plugin that warns you if you use js apis that are not available in the browsers ou need to support
## TODO
vim setup
- eslint -> needs to use the one in your node modules
- yarn setup with vim
